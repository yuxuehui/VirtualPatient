The difference $\Delta$ is used to update the patient‚Äôs state $\textbf{x}$, calculated using the CGD step as shown in the following equation:

The $\textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.32,0.43}{\text{purple variables}}$ correspond to the personalised learnable simulation parameters $\textbf{u}$. The feature variables $\textbf{u}$ for 39 patients were trained on the patients' offline data and are stored in the file [vpatient_params.csv](https://github.com/yuxuehui/VirtualPatient/blob/main/Data/vpatient_params.csv).

<!-- ### Simulated Environment
VirtualPatients simulates the users' blood glucoses changes, under the intervene of meal size, insulin dosage, and exercise intensity. 

Utilizing the VirtualPatients simulator, one can access a "live" environment just like the real online healthcare environment. This simulator generates virtual patients individually, each beginning with an initial physiological metric, such as blood glucose levels. Algorithms are then tasked with formulating treatment recommendations, encompassing aspects like meal size, insulin dosage, and exercise intensity. Following the implementation of these treatments, the virtual patient provides feedback, indicating how their physiological metrics have responded, akin to the responses one would expect from real-life patients. This feedback loop simulates real-world patient responses, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness of treatment strategies.

1) We provide 30 virtual patients, modified from *the glucose-insulin system* [1], which is the open source part of the DMMS.R and T1DM simulators developed by The Epsilon Group and has been certified by the US FDA. The glucose-insulin system is an existing dynamic model of glucose ingestion and absorption, which is obtained through an extremely challenging triple tracer meal protocol by tracking the glucose conversion dynamic in the meals of 204 normal individuals. 

2) Besides, we provide 9 real-wrold patients trained through dataset from Dnurse. How these nine patients were trained is described in:

3) Each patient (both 30 virtual patients and 9 real-world patients) is associated with 61 static attributes. Here, static/dynmaic means whether the features will change during an interactive process. The attributes information about involve patient age, patient gender, patient , etc.

4) We provide  -->

## Designing healthcare interventions through a decision algorithm

### VirtualPatients Intervention Schemes

**VirtualPatients** provides three intervention schemes to meet the personalised needs of different patients:  
1) **Dietary intervention**  
2) **Medication intervention**  
3) **Combined dietary and medication intervention**  

(An interface for exercise intervention will be made available soon.)  

The intervention scheme is configured using five parameters: `info_phase_length`, `flag`, `meal_time`, `default_meal`, and `default_insulin`. The details of each parameter are as follows:  

- **`flag`**: Determines the control mode with a value of 0, 1, or 2.  
  - `0`: Controls carbohydrates only.  
  - `1`: Controls insulin only.  
  - `2`: Controls both carbohydrates and insulin.  

- **`info_phase_length`**: the number of time steps per day.  
  - `3` when `flag=0`, three meals per day.  
  - `1440` for other `flag` values. Basal/bolus insulin injections are once per minute, so 1440 insulin doses are required in a natural day. 

- **`meal_time`**: Specifies meal times in a list with three elements (in minutes). Default value: `[360, 660, 1080]`  

- **`default_meal`**: Specifies the default meal size, used when `flag=0`. Formatted as a list with three elements. Default value: `[50, 50, 50]`  

- **`default_insulin`**: Specifies the default insulin dosage, used when `flag=1`. Formatted as a float. Default value: `0.01`  

Additionally, do not forget change the `action_range` according to different intervention schemes and the need of your control methods, which is used to specify the range of values for the action space.

You can use VirtualPatients to evaluate various types of control methods, such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Below is an example of a Python implementation using PPO:

```python
from virtual_patient.envs.env_do_all_her_2reward import CBNEnv
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
env = CBNEnv.create(    # initialise a environment
        info_phase_length=1440,
        action_range=args.action_range,
        vertex=args.vertex,
        reward_scale=args.reward_scale,
        n_env=1,
        patient_ID=args.patient_ID,
        list_last_vertex=[],
        flag=0,
        meal_time=[300,600,1000],
        default_meal=[50,100,100],
        default_insulin=0.02
    )
optimizer_kwargs = dict(
        alpha=0.95,
    )
policy_kwargs = dict(
        optimizer_kwargs=optimizer_kwargs,
        optimizer_class=RMSpropTFLike
    )

model = PPO("MlpPolicy", # initialise a PPO model
            env,
            n_steps=5,
            gae_lambda=0.95,
            gamma=0.9,
            n_epochs=10,
            ent_coef=0.0,
            learning_rate=float(1e-4),
            clip_range=0.2,
            use_sde=True,
            sde_sample_freq=4,
            verbose=1,
            tensorboard_log='../logs',
            seed=94566)

model.learn(    # train
    total_timesteps=int(3e7),
    callback=TensorboardCallback())

env.close()
